so I wanted to try seeding a database to get more familiar with it. I'm not sure if I need it because once I 
add a router it keeps making my server crash since things come up undefined. my server works fine right now though
8/2/2020. I'm not sure why. Anyway 
seeding a database is a process in which an inital(original)set of sata is being provided to a database when it is being installed. 
I just wanted to add some original words to already be hosted besides the user adding their own. */
